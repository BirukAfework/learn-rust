# 50 Rust Projects to Master Core Concepts ðŸ¦€

This is me Biruk i'm trying to learn Rust's core concepts to advance from scratch project one to complex one just clone the repository and try learning.
Project i'm going to work on. projects which have âœ… are alreadly done and the codes are in directory's.

List of prokjects.
